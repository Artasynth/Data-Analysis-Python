# Medicare Inpatient Hospital Data Analysis  

## **Background and Research Questions**  
The financial structure of the healthcare system is influenced by the interactions between hospitals, service providers, and the costs borne by insurance companies and government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. As Medicare expenditures continue to rise, it is crucial to analyze the factors driving these costs. Public opinion often supports expanded coverage, yet the complexities of healthcare pricing make it difficult to fully grasp where these costs originate. The **Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)** provides extensive data tracking various healthcare metrics, including provider payments, charges, and patient demographics, offering valuable insights into these trends.  

## **Business Task Statement**  
This analysis aims to explore trends and relationships within Medicare inpatient hospital data, with a particular focus on payments, hospital characteristics, patient demographics, and **state-level variations**. Using data from **Medicare Inpatient Hospitals - by Provider** and **Hospitals General Information**, this study investigates how factors such as **hospital ownership, patient age groups, service volume, and geographic location** relate to Medicare inpatient payments.  

### ** Example Research Questions:**  
- How have Medicare inpatient payments and discharges changed over the six years (2017-2022)?  
- What factors, such as **hospital ownership, patient age groups, or service volume**, are associated with higher payments?  
- Are there observable trends in inpatient payments based on **provider characteristics**?  
- How do **state-level differences** affect Medicare payments and hospital discharges?  

## **Data Sources**  
This study uses two key datasets:  
1. **Medicare Inpatient Hospitals - by Provider**: Contains hospital-level data on discharges, charges, and payments under Medicare’s Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS).  
2. **Hospitals General Information**: Includes details on hospital ownership, location, and capacity.

The datasets cover **2017-2022**, with each year’s data individually downloaded. CMS also provides a structured data dictionary detailing key variables. The analysis will focus on selected fields relevant to payments, patient demographics, state-level trends, and hospital characteristics.
